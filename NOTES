soft-dirty works on PPC, x86, amd64, MIPS... but not arm or arm64, which is kind of important for us.
I'm going to see if we can get away with emulating it via whether a page is mapped from file or not.
We could always fall back to this approach on Linux platforms without softdirty, but that's getting
complicated; the only real perf difference would come from the extra mmap call & associated page table
setup.

On my shitty arm64 laptop:
- a fork() of a proc with a 2GB loom mapped takes 0.2 ms
- a mmap() of a 2GB loom on top of an existing one (clobbering the existing mapping according to Linux
  source and POSIX 2017, which is what we want) takes 0.005 ms (not considering the slight cost of tlb clear)

OK, it turns out soft-dirty is precisely as fast as hard-dirty which is slower than userfaultfd which is as fast as libsigsegv. who knew?
